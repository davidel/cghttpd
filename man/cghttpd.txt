NAME
       cghttpd - coronet/guasi based HTTP server


SYNOPSIS
       cghttpd [-p PORT] [-r ROOTFS] [-L LSNBKLOG] [-S STKSIZE] [-m MINTHREAD]
       [-M MAXTHREADS] [-N] [-h]


DESCRIPTION
       cghttpd is a simple web server that can be used to measure the  perfor-
       mance  of network events delivery and generic IO completions, driven by
       a coroutine based dispatch engine. The cghttpd server is based  on  the
       coronet      library     available     at     the     following     URL
       http://www.xmailserver.org/coronet-lib.html .  The coronet  library  is
       in  turn  based  on  the  epoll support available in the 2.6 (or newer)
       serie of Linux kernels, with glibc version of 2.3.2 or newer. The coro-
       net  library  is  also  based  on libpcl available at the following URL
       http://www.xmailserver.org/libpcl.html .  The cghttpd server is finally
       based on the guasi library, that allows it to handle potentially block-
       ing system calls, in an asyncrounous way. The guasi library  is  avail-
       able  at  the following URL http://www.xmailserver.org/guasi-lib.html .
       The cghttpd will not daemonize, and ^C can be used to stop it.



OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by cghttpd:

       -p PORT
              Specifies the port onto which cghttpd will listen to PORT.

       -r ROOTFS
              Specifies the home directory for cghttpd to ROOTFS.

       -L LSNBKLOG
              Specifies the listen(2) backlog size to LSNBKLOG.

       -S STKSIZE
              Specifies the stack size to be used for the coroutines  to  STK-
              SIZE.

       -m MINTHREAD
              Specifies  the  minimum  number  of threads for the guasi thread
              pool to MINTHREAD.

       -M MAXTHREAD
              Specifies the maximum number of threads  for  the  guasi  thread
              pool to MAXTHREAD.

       -N     Uses the O_NOATIME flag when opening the content file.

       -h     Prints a usage screen.
